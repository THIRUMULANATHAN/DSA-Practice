# DSA Practice Repository

A complete collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in C, C++, Java, and Python.  
This repository is structured for placement preparation, concept revision, and coding practice.

---

## About

This repository contains:

- Core DSA implementations  
- Graph algorithms  
- Tree operations  
- Expression conversion problems  
- C++ STL practice  
- Revision modules  
- General coding exercises  

The goal is to maintain a clean, organized reference for improving problem-solving skills and preparing for interviews.
